# Agents: how to pick up work here

1. Read `docs/HANDOFF.md` first — one screen: where we are, what is claimed, what
   is blocked, the next agent's first move.
2. Pick a package from `docs/work/`: `status: open`, every `depends_on` already in
   `docs/work/done/`, lowest id first. One claimed package per agent at a time.
3. Claim it in its own commit before writing code: `status: claimed`,
   `owner: agent`, `updated:` today, on branch `agent/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>`, pushed at
   once so the claim is visible.
4. Work inside the package's Scope; never widen it; never answer its Open questions
   yourself — a human answers them in `docs/open-questions.md`.
5. End every session with: a `docs/LOG.md` entry (newest first), `docs/HANDOFF.md`
   rewritten, the package at `status: review`, and a pull request a person reviews.
   Run `uv run tools/validate.py` first — it checks all of this.

The convention in full, written for people: `docs/work/README.md`. The project
itself: `CLAUDE.md`. The step-by-step procedure an agent follows:
`.claude/skills/next-work-package/SKILL.md`.
